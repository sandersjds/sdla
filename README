// the humble beginnings and change history of the service data log annihilator:
// friday, april 9, 2010. because all big projects start on fridays.
// original idea courtesy of JOE SHIPMAN.
// version 1 published to the 7x daylighters april 19, 2010
// version 2 published april 29, 2010, added support for caching files and other excitement
// version 3 published june 29, 2010, added file browser, vdbg/sol parsing, mike sparks' requests, and dozens of fixes
// version 4 published oct 29, 2010 (officially): new server, dozens of fixes, and the power tab (which is incomplete)

// KNOWN GOTCHAS (no current intention to fix)
//  machine support
//    telco chassis support - data structures vary widely between firmware versions and machine types

// TODO
//  machine support
//    7872 HX5 blade: additional firmware information (FPGA) as well as scale data parsing
//    8028/8014 issues:
//      these blades list all sorts of things as things they are not
//      current notables:
//        49Y4458: (SATA Controller card) lists as "SYS CARD EX," which is shared with management cards on POWER blades
//        46C7171: MR10ie lists as "ADDIN CARD," shared with CKVM cards
//  bugs
//    all machines with sidecar processor blades (this includes PS702 blades and scaled HX5 blades, potentially others)
//     currently list their child PCI devices and memory banks improperly
//  eventlog
//    time-shift event timestamps
//    proper css for the controls for the table
//  basics
//    possibly collapse all the arrays into one big one to make globals easier?
//    isolate procedural code out of index.php (this will be a big one)
//    better seperate syntax and semantics (also a big one)
//    get into w3-compliant format (lol)
